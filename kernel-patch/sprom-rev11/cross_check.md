# Cross-validation against canonical Broadcom SROM rev-11 layout

## What this document tracks

The patch series pins rev-11 byte offsets by value-matching `wl srdump`
against `wl nvram_dump` on a single reference board (DSL-3580L). The
authoritative source for the same offsets is Broadcom's own
`bcmsrom_tbl.h` (released GPLv2-with-linking-exception in `bcmdhd`,
asuswrt-merlin, and several vendor trees; see top-level README for
specific URLs).

Every `SSB_SPROM11_*` constant in `harness/ssb_regs.h` ought to match
the corresponding `SROM11_*` entry in `bcmsrom_tbl.h`. This file is the
ledger of those checks.

## Findings to date

### 1. IL0MAC / CCODE offset collision (resolved, v3 fix scoped)

`bcmsrom_tbl.h` rev-11 entry table excerpt:

    {"boardnum",  0xfffff800, 0,            SROM11_MACLO,  0xffff},
    {"macaddr",   0xfffff800, SRFL_ETHADDR, SROM11_MACHI,  0xffff},
    {"ccode",     0xfffff800, SRFL_CCODE,   SROM11_CCODE,  0xffff},
    {"regrev",    0xfffff800, 0,            SROM11_REGREV, 0x00ff},

`bcmsrom.h` numeric definitions (word indices):

    SROM11_MACHI    = 72   (byte 0x090)
    SROM11_MACMID   = 73   (byte 0x092)
    SROM11_MACLO    = 74   (byte 0x094)
    SROM11_CCODE    = 75   (byte 0x096)
    SROM11_REGREV   = 76   (byte 0x098)

The v2 patch's `SSB_SPROM11_IL0MAC = 0x0090` is correct: it is the
`SROM11_MACHI` start of the 3-word MAC (MACHI/MACMID/MACLO at 0x90,
0x92, 0x94). The byte zeroing at MAC[2..3] in the synth-mode runs
came from the v2 patch reading ccode at the rev-8 offset 0x92 — which
is `SROM11_MACMID`, the middle word of the MAC. Case (b) is the
correct one; case (a) is falsified.

**v3 fix (scoped, validated in harness):**

    #define SSB_SPROM11_CCODE   0x0096   /* word 75, mask 0xffff */
    #define SSB_SPROM11_REGREV  0x0098   /* word 76, mask 0x00ff */

    SPEX(country_code, SSB_SPROM11_CCODE, ~0, 0);   /* was SSB_SPROM8_CCODE */

Applied to `harness/extract_r11.c`, `harness/synth_srom.c`,
`harness/ssb_regs.h`. Result on the four committed vectors:

  - DSL-3580L raw: 77 PASS / 0 FAIL / 2 INFO (unchanged, SROM region
    0x90..0x95 reads zero on this board).
  - D6220 raw:     74 PASS / 0 FAIL / 5 INFO (unchanged, idem).
  - bcm4360usb synth: il0mac MAC bytes no longer zeroed by ccode write
    (Finding 1 collision gone).
  - agcombo synth: 75 PASS / 0 FAIL / 4 INFO; `il0mac` moves from
    `INFO MAC corruption` to `PASS`.

The kernel-mainline patch file `0001-*.patch` still encodes v2; v3
regeneration is a single-block edit (add the two `#define` lines,
flip one `SPEX` call site) and gated on the bring-up MVP completing
on hardware before any upstream send.

### 2. Rxgains bit-packing (verified self-consistent)

`bcma_sprom_unpack_rxgains()` decodes a packed byte as
`(trelnabyp<<7) | (triso<<3) | elnagain`. The bcm4360usb synth-mode
run encodes triplets `(3, 9, 1)` (5 GHz) and `(4, 9, 1)` (2.4 GHz) via
the inverse, then round-trips them through `extract_r11`:

    chain 0: rxgains_2g.{elnagain=4, triso=9, trelnabyp=1}  → PASS
    chain 0: rxgains_5gl.{elnagain=3, triso=9, trelnabyp=1} → PASS
    chain 1: same triplets                                  → PASS

The triplets come from a different chip family than the DSL-3580L (and
have non-saturated `triso=9`, not the 15 that swamps the DSL-3580L
dump), so the bit-width allocation has been exercised on values that
would expose any 0/1-bit shift error.

This is round-trip self-consistency, not external truth: synth and
parse both use the same encoding by construction. To anchor it
externally, look up the masks for `rxgains*elnagaina*` /
`rxgains*trisoa*` / `rxgains*trelnabypa*` in `bcmsrom_tbl.h` and
confirm they match `0x07 / 0x78 / 0x80` respectively.

### 3. ANTAVAIL / TXRXC / SUBBAND5GVER (verified by bcm4360usb)

These three offsets pass on the bcm4360usb synth-mode run with
non-degenerate inputs:

    aa2g=3, aa5g=3      → ANTAVAIL=0xA0  word 0x303 → PASS both halves
    txchain/rxchain=3   → TXRXC=0xA8     packed → PASS
    subband5gver=0x4    → 0xD6           PASS

DSL-3580L's `aa2g=0` made the bg-half check trivial; bcm4360usb fills
both halves and so confirms that ANTAVAIL packs `aa5g<<8 | aa2g` into
a single u16 at the v2-corrected byte offset. Same for TXRXC.

### 4. Per-chain power-info block stride (verified by bcm4360usb chains 0/1, D6220 chains 0/1/2)

The patch declares the per-chain block stride at 0x28 starting at 0xD8:

    SSB_SPROM11_PWR_INFO_CORE0 = 0x00D8
    SSB_SPROM11_PWR_INFO_CORE1 = 0x0100
    SSB_SPROM11_PWR_INFO_CORE2 = 0x0128

The bcm4360usb vector populates two chains with different `pa2ga` /
`pa5ga` arrays (chain 0 starts `0xff34, 0x19d6, 0xfccf`, chain 1
starts `0xff27, 0x1895, 0xfced`). Both chains round-trip cleanly,
confirming the stride is exactly 0x28 and not 0x26 or 0x2A — an
off-by-one would mix chain-0 `pa5ga` data into chain-1's `pa2ga` slot
and the diff would explode immediately.

Chain 2 stride is now independently verified by the D6220 board,
which populates all three chains with `pa5ga[12]` distinct word-by-word
from the DSL-3580L and an asymmetric `maxp5ga0=(72,70,86,0)` (vs
DSL's symmetric `(76,76,76,76)`). The D6220 chain-2 block at 0x128
parses cleanly against the NVRAM oracle on every per-chain field,
which would not happen if 0x128 were off by even one word.

## How to fill the canonical column

This document deliberately does not embed a transcription of the
rev-11 entries from `bcmsrom_tbl.h`. The file is large and its rev-11
section was past the truncation point of every fetch attempted at
write-time of this harness. To populate the column locally:

1. Clone one of:
   - `https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin` (`release/src-rt-7.x.main/src/include/bcmsrom_tbl.h`)
   - `https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common.git` at the `bcmdhd-3.10` branch
   - `https://github.com/StreamUnlimited/broadcom-bcmdhd-4359` (`include/bcmsrom_tbl.h`)
2. Grep `bcmsrom_tbl.h` for entries whose `revmask` has bit 11 set, e.g.
   `0x00000800` (rev 11 only) or `0xfffff800` (rev 11+):
       grep -E '0x[0-9a-fA-F]*8[0-9a-fA-F]{2}\b' bcmsrom_tbl.h
3. For each entry whose name appears in this document's status table,
   resolve its `off` macro via `bcmsrom_fmt.h` (also in `include/`) into
   a word offset, multiply by 2 to get the byte offset, and compare
   against the patch's value.
4. Update the right-hand column of the status table with the result.
5. If the IL0MAC vs. CCODE collision (Finding 1) resolves to a bug in
   one of the two offsets, fix `ssb_regs.h` and the patch hunk
   accordingly, then re-run `make check && make check-bcm4360usb`.
